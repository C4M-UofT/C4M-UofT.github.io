### Description of the Dataset

This dataset involves 100 H&E stained histology images of colorectal adenocarcinomas. A total number of 29,756 nuclei were marked at the center for detection purposes. Out of which, there were 22,444 nuclei that also have an associated class label, i.e. epithelial, inflammatory, fibroblast, and miscellaneous. Full details of the dataset can be found in 

- Sirinukunwattana et al., ‘Locality Sensitive Deep Learning for Detection and Classification of Nuclei in Routine Colon Cancer Histology Images’, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2016. (in press)


Each image is contained in a separate folder, and the ground truth data for nucleus detection and classification are provided as nuclear coordinates in ‘.mat’ (MATLAB).
