    "When we write programs, they don't always work as expected.  Sometimes the problems with programs are obvious, but other times they are more subtle.  In this lesson, we explore how to test whether a program works correctly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also teach how to use a software tool called a *debugger* to examine code to find the source of problems.  We say that a program is buggy, if it doesn't work as expected and can use a debugger to find [bugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing a program\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether a program is correct, we execute it.  Let's say that we have written a function to add two numbers.  Is executing the add function once enough to ensure that it works as expected?  Ideally, we would execute a program with all possible inputs, but that isn't usually realistic.  We can't test our add function with all possible combinations of numbers, because we'd have an infinite number of test cases!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of testing with all possible values, we use a set of values that we chose to represent the various categories of inputs.  For example, we might try adding two possible numbers, a negative number and a positive number, and so on.  We might also test with both integers and floats.  \n",

    "* **Size**\n",
    "    For collections (strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.):\n",
    "        * empty collection\n",
    "        * a collection with one item\n",
    "        * smallest interesting case\n",
    "        * collection with several items\n",
    "* **Dichotomies**\n",
    "    Depending on the problem, testing dichomomies might be relevant (e.g., vowels/non-vowels, even/odd, positive/negative, empty/full, etc.)\n",
    "* **Boundaries**\n",
    "    If a function behaves differently near a particular threshold (e.g., an `if` statement checking whether a value is 3; 3 is a threshold), then test at that threshold.\n",
    "* **Order**\n",
    "    If a function behaves differently when the values are in a different order, identify and test each of those orders.\n",

In addition, it cannot be used with programs that involve reading from or writing to files.\n",
