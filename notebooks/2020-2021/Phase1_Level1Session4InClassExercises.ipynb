    "The notebook contains several hidden code cells, which are displayed as three dots. To run these, select the above cell and press run twice (either by the buttons on the top, or the \"shift\" + \"return\" hotkey). Once the hidden code cell runs, a message such as \"Done\" or your evaluation results should appear. If the code expands, please collapse it using the column on the left. You don't need to edit or understand the code in these cells. \n",

    "2.   The second cell contains the starter code, and contains a comment indicating where you should write your code. Your entire implementation will go in this cell. \n",
    "3.   The third cell is a testing cell for your own testing. Feel free to write any code you like here to test your function is working correctly.\n",

    "#### Completion ####\n",
    "The completion cell runs all the test cases in the notebook on all the functions. If this cell returns full marks, this means the notebook is complete. Once complete, upload this notebook to MarkUs."

    "### Valid DNA Sequence ###\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA sequences have traditionally been represented as strings of the symbols A, C, G, and T, which represent the nucleobases, found in natural DNA. Scientists have recently uncovered the importance of chemical modifications to numerous nucleobases. While many of these were previously known, they have recently been shown to likely have impacts on the regulation of genes (specific sequences of nucleobases that encode for various functional units in cells, often the class of large bio-molecules called proteins). Many other modifications have only recently been discovered and found to be involved in essential cellular processes, some necessary for the development of various organisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to analyze these modifications computationally, researchers at U of T have proposed\n",
    "and made use of an additional set of symbols, in effect, defining an expanded DNA alphabet. For example, cytosine (C) is often modified, by the addition of a methyl group (a CH3) at its fifth carbon, forming 5-methylcytosine. These researchers assign the symbol m to this nucleobase, adding a fifth symbol to the DNA alphabet. They have already defined other symbols and there may be more to come.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem you will write a function valid_DNA_sequence that takes a sequence and a\n",
    "DNA nucleobase alphabet, and determines if all the symbols in the sequence are from those in the provided alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the function below."
