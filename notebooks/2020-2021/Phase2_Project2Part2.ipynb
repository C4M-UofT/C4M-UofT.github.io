    "On the highest level, the notebook is comprised of two sections. The exercise section and completion section.\n",

    "#### Hidden Code ####\n",
    "The notebook contains several hidden code cells, which are displayed as three dots. To run these, select the above cell and press run twice (either by the buttons on the top, or the \"shift\" + \"return\" hotkey). Once the hidden code cell runs, a message such as \"Done\" or your evaluation results should appear. If the code expands, please collapse it using the column on the left. You don't need to edit or understand the code in these cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Starting out ####\n",
    "The first cell in the exercise section is titled \"Run the hidden code cell before starting\". This should be run everytime a new kernel/runtime is started. If run correctly, the message \"Done!\" should appear underneath.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercises ####\n",
    "This is followed by all the exercises of the notebook. An exercise generally consists of 4 cells. \n",
    "1.   The first cell provides a description of the function you need to implement. \n",
    "2.   The second cell contains the starter code, and contains a comment indicating where you should write your code. Your entire implementation will go in this cell. \n",
    "3.   The third cell is a testing cell for your own testing. Feel free to write any code you like here to test your function is working correctly.\n",
    "4.   The last cell contains hidden code to run test cases on your function. This cell, when run, will provide a mark on your implementation. If implemented correctly, you should get full marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completion ####\n",
    "The completion cell runs all the test cases in the notebook on all the functions. If this cell returns full marks, this means the notebook is complete. Once complete, upload this notebook to MarkUs."
