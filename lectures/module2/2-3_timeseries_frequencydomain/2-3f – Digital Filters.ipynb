In the filter signal's FFT, however, you should see some of that frequency content disappear depending on where you set the your cutoff frequency. This shows that the low-pass filter is working as intended: attenuating higher frequencies and passing lower ones.\n",
        "* **Time domain (smoothness):** Applying the low-pass filter makes are signal much smoother since the spikes were essentially higher frequency sinusoids being super-imposed on the ideal signal we were trying to capture. Smoothing the signal can make it easier to identify peaks, valleys, and trends in your data.\n",
        "* **Time domain (amplitude):** As we lower the cutoff frequency, you might notice that the filtered signal in the bottom-left actually becomes shorter in amplitude. This is because some of the amplitude was coming from the higher frequencies. Therefore, filtering may not be ideal if the exact amplitude of your signal is really important.\n",
