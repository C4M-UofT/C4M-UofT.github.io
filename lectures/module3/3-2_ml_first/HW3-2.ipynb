        "1. **.ipynb:** First, confirm that your code can run from start to finish without any errors. To check this, go to \"Runtime\" > \"Run all\" in the Google Colab menu. If everything looks good, you can export your file by going to \"File\" > \"Download\" > \"Download .ipynb\".\n",
        "2. **.pdf:** Run the function called `colab2pdf()` below. This will automatically convert your notebook to a PDF. Note that while \"File\" > \"Print\" > \"Save as PDF\" also works, it requires you to manually expand all of the cells and may cut off some images."
