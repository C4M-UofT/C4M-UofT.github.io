This dataset is actually composed of data collected by three institutions. Together, these institutions recruited 93 patients with idiopathic PD and 73 healthy controls. During enrollment, subjects were asked to complete a number of clinical scales to assess the severity of their Parkinsonian symptoms. The clinical scale we will focus on the most is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). This scale is composed of four different parts, but we will focus on the portion that deals with motor control function (Part III)."

The output of each of these 16 sensors has been digitized and recorded at 100 Hz, and the records also include two signals that reflect the sum of the 8 sensor outputs for each foot."
