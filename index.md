This program will provide learners with a comprehensive introduction to data science in the Python programming language. 
Participants in this program will learn how to use powerful tools to analyze time-series data, process images, train machine learning models, and create visualizations. 
By the end of the program, participants will come away with the skills and mindset needed to delve into tasks ranging from speech analysis to image classification.

Participants joining this program are expected to have some familiarity with programming, ideally in the Python programming language. To see the prerequisite knowledge required for the program or to get a refresher in Python programming, participants are strongly encouraged to look through the materials in the [Review tab]({{site.url}}/review.html) before the start of the first lecture.

We will be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for most of the lecture materials, in-class exercises, and assignments.
