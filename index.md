# Overview

Welcome to the webpage for the 2019 Computing for Medicine workshops.
This three-phased program offers medical students hands-on experience to learn basic computing skills. You will be assigned either Beginner or Advanced level based on a skills-testing exercise during Session 1. Phase 1 will be optional for students in the advanced cohort.


# Course Objectives

## Phase 1: 
Programming bootcamp (October to December 2019)
At the end of the programming boot camp, you should be able to:
- Write very basic Python programs involving variables, conditionals, iteration, functions in simple combinations.
- Trace basic Python programs involving lists, dictionaries and files.
- Recognize good practices in software design (modular design and conventional naming standards).

## Phase 2: 
Project-Based Learning (January to March 2020)
At the end of Phase 2, you should be able to:
- Write programs that combine concepts from Phase 1: conditionals, iteration, functions, lists, dictionaries and files.
- Given a problem description in English, write programs to solve the problem.
- Consistently use good practice in software design (modular design, documentation and conventional naming standards).
- Use a debugger to find mistakes in a program written by another author.

## Phase 3: 
Independent Medical Data Science Project (April 2020 to May 2020)
At the end of Phase 3, you should be able to:
- Devise algorithmic solutions to real-world problems and implement prototypes of the solutions in Python. 
- Have familiarity with several applications of computer science in the fields of medicine and biomedical research and will have experience with building prototypes in those domains.
