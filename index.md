Welcome to the webpage for the 2022-2023 Computing for Medicine (C4M) Workshops.
This program offers medical students hands-on experience learning basic computing skills in the Python programming language. Nevertheless, the concepts learned in this program should translate to many other popular languages.

During the first session, all students will be asked to take this [skills assessment](https://colab.research.google.com/github/C4M-UofT/C4M-UofT.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/C4M_Pre_course_Skills_Assessment.ipynb). 
Students who pass this assessment will have the option to skip Sessions 1 (second half), 2, and 3 in Phase 1, although they will still be asked to complete the corresponding assignments.

## Course Objectives

### Phase 1: Programming Bootcamp (October–December 2022)
- Write very basic Python programs involving variables, conditionals, iteration, functions in simple combinations.
- Trace basic Python programs involving lists, dictionaries and files.
- Recognize good practices in software design (modular design and conventional naming standards).

### Phase 2: Project-Based Learning (January–April 2023)
- Write programs that combine concepts from Phase 1: conditionals, iteration, functions, lists, dictionaries and files.
- Devise algorithmic solutions to real-world problems and implement prototypes of the solutions in Python.
- Use a debugger to find mistakes in a program written by another author.
- Consistently use good practice in software design (modular design, documentation and conventional naming standards).
- Given a problem description in English, write programs to solve the problem.
