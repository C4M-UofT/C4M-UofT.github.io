Welcome to the webpage for the 2021-2022 Computing for Medicine (C4M) Workshops.
This three-phase program offers medical students hands-on experience learning basic computing skills in the `Python` programming language, althouth the concepts learned in this program should translate to most other languages.

Before the first lecture, each student should take the [skills assessment](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZXEx2mUiVEzdrzff8JUjYSD0qqrLR3oH) to determine whether the first few courses will benefit you. 
Phase 1 of the program is optional for students who pass the assessment.

## Course Objectives

### Phase 1: Programming Bootcamp (October–December 2021)
- Write very basic Python programs involving variables, conditionals, iteration, functions in simple combinations.
- Trace basic Python programs involving lists, dictionaries and files.
- Recognize good practices in software design (modular design and conventional naming standards).

### Phase 2: Project-Based Learning (January–March 2022)
- Write programs that combine concepts from Phase 1: conditionals, iteration, functions, lists, dictionaries and files.
- Use a debugger to find mistakes in a program written by another author.
- Consistently use good practice in software design (modular design, documentation and conventional naming standards).
- Given a problem description in English, write programs to solve the problem.

### Phase 3: Independent Medical Data Science Project (April–May 2022)
- Devise algorithmic solutions to real-world problems and implement prototypes of the solutions in Python.
