Welcome to the webpage for the 2021-2022 Computing for Medicine (C4M) Workshops.
This three-phase program offers medical students hands-on experience learning basic computing skills in the Python programming language, althouth the concepts learned in this program should translate to most other languages.

During the first session, all students will be asked to take this [skills assessment](https://colab.research.google.com/github/C4M-UofT/C4M-UofT.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/c4m_intro_quiz.ipynb). 
Attendance to Sessions 1 (second half), 2, and 3 in Phase 1 will be optional for students who pass the assessments, although they will still be asked to complete the corresponding assignments.

## Course Objectives

### Phase 1: Programming Bootcamp (October–December 2021)
- Write very basic Python programs involving variables, conditionals, iteration, functions in simple combinations.
- Trace basic Python programs involving lists, dictionaries and files.
- Recognize good practices in software design (modular design and conventional naming standards).

### Phase 2: Project-Based Learning (January–March 2022)
- Write programs that combine concepts from Phase 1: conditionals, iteration, functions, lists, dictionaries and files.
- Use a debugger to find mistakes in a program written by another author.
- Consistently use good practice in software design (modular design, documentation and conventional naming standards).
- Given a problem description in English, write programs to solve the problem.

### Phase 3: Independent Medical Data Science Project (April–May 2022)
- Devise algorithmic solutions to real-world problems and implement prototypes of the solutions in Python.
