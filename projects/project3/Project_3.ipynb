Each year, PhysioNet hosts a challenge in which researchers and hobbyists can compete to see who can create the most accurate models for a given problem, with previous challenges including sleep apnea detection and heart sound classification (https://physionetchallenges.org/).\n",

Early detection and treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4â€“8% increase in mortality [1, 2]. The challenge gave people access to a dataset containing demographic information, vital signs, and lab reports. Your model will load this data, split it into separate groups for different purposes, and then train and evaluate your model."

        "In the previous section, we split the data into training and test sets to see how well our model would generalize to unseen data. However, those splits were not as independent as they should be. The `train_test_split()` function randomly splits the rows in the dataset, but multiple rows belong to same patient. This means that data from patient $P_1$ can appear in both the training and test datasets.\n",
        "If that happens, the model is essentially \"peeking at the answers\" ahead of time, so even if a model has high accuracy on the test dataset, we cannot argue that it will work for other unseen patients.\n",
        "\n",
        "To fix this issue, we will split our data using a variant of **$k$-fold cross-validation**. A typical $k$-fold cross-validation procedure goes as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Rather than splitting the data into a single pair of training and testing sets, we split the data into $k$ number of sets (called **folds**) of equal size.\n",
        "* For each fold, we do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * We select one fold to hold out as the test set and use the remaining $k-1$ folds collectively as the training set.\n",
        "  * We fit a model on the training set and evaluate on the test set as we would normally do.\n",
        "  * We save the prediction results for the training and test datasets, but we discard the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "* At this point, all of the folds will have been the test set at least once, which means we will have a prediction for each sample. We can therefore calculate the performance of our modeling approach the same way as we did before.\n",
        "\n",
        "This still does not solve our problem of maintaining independence, which is why we need to use a variant of $k$-fold cross-validation. We will stratify our data according to the `patient` column before we split it into folds so that rows from the same patient can only appear in one fold. `scikit-learn` has an object called `GroupKFold` that will do this for us:"
